        <h4>Western Avenue Streetscape Project
          Traffic Update & Restaurant Parking</h4>

        <div class="text">
          <p>Starting from Mid February 2015 there will be construction along Western Avenue between NW 41st – NW 45th
            street. In order to better serve our customers, please refer to the parking map and directions for your
            convenience.</p>

          <p>
            North bound traffic between NW 41st and NW 42nd on Western Ave will be interrupted by road block. Detour
            signs are set up to direct vehicles into East to Shartel and you can then make your way back from 42nd to
            Western Avenue after one block. Parking space either side from Musashi’s or Sushi Neko/Lobby Café/Will
            Rogers Theater are still plentiful.
            Update will be given each month based upon the progression of the construction. We are sorry for the
            inconvenience but are looking forward to the huge improvement of this area after the streetscape project.
