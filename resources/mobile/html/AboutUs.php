				<p>Carl Milam is the President and Founder of Western Concepts Restaurant Group, LLC, which operates <i>Sushi Neko, Musashi's Japanese Steakhouse, The Lobby Café & Bar, The Tasting Room, Will Roger's Theater and The Coach House.</i></p>
				<p>With a firm background in financial planning, Milam knew he was making an investment in Western Avenue when in 1997 he opened a new restaurant concept, <i>Sushi Neko.</i> At the time, that portion of Western Avenue was floundering.</p>
				<p>But not only did Sushi Neko thrive, it’s success soon brought about the opening of Musashi’s in 2002 right across the street. Not long afterward came <i>The Will Rogers Theatre, The Lobby Café & Bar and The Tasting Room.</i> </p>
				<p>All of these concepts are housed in the area near 43rd and Western in Oklahoma City. And in 2009, Western Concepts partnered with famed Chef Kurt Fleischfresser, adding The <i>Coach House</i> to the Western Concepts Family of Restaurants.</p>
				<p>Currently, Milam serves on the board of the Will Rogers Memorial Foundation as well as the Western Avenue Association, an organization dedicated to the growth and sustainability of Western Avenue as one of Oklahoma City’s flourishing districts. </p>

				<p>At age 20, chef Kurt Fleischfresser began his career at <i>Le Vichyssoise</i> in Chicago under Chef
					Bernard Cretier. He went on to perfect his culinary skills at some of the finest restaurants in the
					nation, such as <i>The French Room</i> at The Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, <i>Enjolie</i> at The Mandalay
					Four Seasons in Los Colinas, <i>Vincent’s on Camelback</i> in Phoenix, and <i>La Champagne</i> at the
					Registry Resort in Scottsdale.</p>
				<p>In 1988, Kurt was invited by his friend Chris Lower to oversee the kitchen at The Coach House.
					Eventually, they became partners and established some of the best restaurants in Oklahoma, including
					<i>The Metro Wine Bar &amp; Bistro, Ground Floor Café (7 locations), Iguana Lounge, Earl’s Rib Palace, The
						Museum Café, Portobello, The Deep Fork Grill, Irma’s Burger Shack, and Montrachet</i> (Tulsa).</p>
				<p>In 2004, Kurt obtained full ownership of The Coach House, and in 2009, joined Carl Milam and Western
					Concepts Restaurant Group. The combined restaurants gross over 8 million dollars annually.</p>
				<p>Chef Kurt has twice been invited to the world-renown James Beard House in New York City as part of
					the Great Regional Chefs Program, and is a two-time finalist in the prestigious American Culinary Gold
					Cup Competition which is the first portion of The Bocuse d’Or. In 2003, Kurt won Oklahoma’s “The Taste
					of Elegance” award sponsored by the Pork Producers. In April of 2009, Kurt was awarded the Medaille de
					Merite by L’Academie de Gastronomie Brillat-Savarin for his contributions in education in the culinary
					arts. </p>
				<p>Kurt currently serves on the Board of Directors for the Oklahoma Restaurant Association and is a
					member of The James Beard Organization and Slow Food.</p>
